	<h1>Super Mario Bros.</h1>

	<p>Mario took up running in 1985. And swimming, and even a bit of Jack and the Beanstalk vine-climbing too. He became a veritable athlete in comparison to his earlier, stodgier self â€“ and by necessity, because there was a princess to be saved.</p> 
	<p>Super Mario Bros. exponentially expanded Mario's world, as now his adventures were no longer adequately contained within the confines of a single screen. He had to run to the right to scroll his way into seeing the rest of the landscape in front of him; an act which quickly became a staple of video games as a whole. All of this was in the name of, hopefully, saving the kidnapped princess from the evil Koopa King.</p>
