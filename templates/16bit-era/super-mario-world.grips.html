	<h1>Super Mario World</h1>

	<p>Mario and the princess eventually took a trip to the scenic Dinosaur Land â€“ where, immediately on arrival, she proceeded to get kidnapped for a third time. Bowser and his bunch of brats had beaten our heroes to their vacation destination and already managed to conquer the land. Luckily, Mario then managed to find a new ally in a dinosaur named Yoshi.</p>
	<p>Yoshi was insatiably hungry, and after Mario hopped up on the saddle on his back, the two set out together on a quest to eat every Koopa-loyal foe in sight. His long, frog-like tongue helped him safely snack from a distance, while chomping down on special Koopa shells activated even more abilities, like winged flight.</p>
