	<h1>Super Mario 64</h1>

	<p>The power of the Nintendo 64 meant that Mario's running, jumping and Koopa-bashing was no longer locked into a simple, flat, two-dimensional view â€“ he could instead run in any direction he wished, with the players at his controls choosing his path with the N64's new analog stick.</p>
	<p>Levels were broken up by magical paintings, each of which housed an entirely different world. It may have taken some adjustment for some to wrap their minds around an all-new dimension of gaming, but it was certainly worth it.</p>
	<p>In the end, Mario once again emerged victorious, his journey went on to set the framework for what has essentially become the modern 3D video game.</p>
